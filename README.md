## Softwares

The Aircraft simulation, control and system analysis was conducted using three tools:

| Tool                                        | Application                                                                                       |

| [FlightÂ Gear](https://www.flightgear.org/); | Graphical flight simulation software                                                              |
| [JSBSim](https://jsbsim.sourceforge.net/);  | Software that implements the flight dynamics model of aerial and spacial vehicles                 |
| [Python](https://www.python.org/);          | Multipurpose programming language. In this case, it's used to interact with FlightGear and JSBSim |

## Scripts

Bellow some description about the scripts:
